# Community-Manager

We live in a generation where tech plays a very important role in almost all our daily activities. <br/>

But there are still some areas where tech could be used but we couldn't really find any proper application in such areas.<br/>

For example: Let's say you give "x" clothes to the laundry guy and he's done with the job and returns back "x-1" clothes. You might've counted it and made a note of it somewhere and he would've done the same as well, but there's always a chance of tampering with it. Instead what we thought was we could actually use the concepts of blockchain to remove the whole trust thing over here.<br/>

This community manager is exactly to curb the above mentioned problem. The above example is just one field where it might be used. There are many more day to day activities where we could perhaps use this and could actually remove the "trust" factor out because you'll have to meet a 100% consensus most of the time as there would be only 2 parties (mostly) involved in this transanction namely the vendor and the user.<br/>

This community manager mainly looks at improving quality of life and theft reduction.<br/>
